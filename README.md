# react-native-app
In this project we work on converting a ReactJS WebApp into a React Native App. This is done by rebuilding the app from scratch using React Native and using limited features which will only be useful in a Mobile App


I'm inviting all ReactJS and React Native Developers who want to increase their projects on their portfolio to come and contribute to this project as it will help solidify your knowledge of React as whole.
